Automata (1.0.0)
================

A highly impractical implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using [Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/titanium-platform/). Titanium is in no way suited to be a particle engine or drawing canvas, but I thought it might be fun to simulate the game using only Titanium Views and math. There's obvious limitations in terms of performance, but it runs surprisingly well.

Supported Platforms
===================

* iOS

TODO
